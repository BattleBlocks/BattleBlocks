# BattleBlocks
NU Bootcamp Final MERN Project
<br>
<ul>
<li>BattleBlocks is a two-player strategy game, with blocks randomly distributed on two sides of the board</li>
<li>The <strong>Main Player</strong> is on the left, and <strong>Opponent</strong> is on the right</li>
<li>The object of the game is to earn points</li>
<li>Your points are accumulated and last forever, so the top point holders are on the leaderboard</li>
<li>To earn points, you have to click on the 3rd-to-last, 2nd-to-last, or last block on your side</li>
<li>Of course your opponent is trying to click on the blocks on their side, to keep you from earning points</li>
</ul>
<br>
There are two wrinkles that make the game interesting....
1) The computer randomly intervenes 
2) There is "money" in the game, which you can use to improve your chances of earning points
